# vetero

Vetero means weather in esperanto language and it is a responsive single page application showing a 5 day weather forecast based on OpenWeatherMap API.

The demo application is available at https://vetero.herokuapp.com/#/

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
yarn run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Run tests
```
yarn run test
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```

### Run end-to-end tests
```
yarn run test:e2e
```

### Run unit tests
```
yarn run test:unit
```

### Solution

The solution was implemented with use of the Vue.js framework.

The main toolset includes:

- Typescript
- Webpack 4
- Babel 7
- Eslint
- Sass
- FomanticUI
- Jest testing framework,
- nightwatch - e2e testing framework

The src files were divided into:
- views - containing application views. In case of this application is a single Main view.
- components - containing all the rest of non-view components,
- services - containing services for communication with external APIs and other functionalities utilized by components but not being part of their interface,


The main view of the application consists of 4 child components representing 4 separate parts of the application:
- CitySelector - a component responsible for selection of the city for the weather forecast,
- CurrentWeather - the component showing a current weather in the selected city,
- DayMenu - the component showing overview of the weather forecast for all the days, and allowing for selection of the specific day,
- Forecast - a component showing detailed weather forecast in three different manners,
    * Hourly,
    * Daily Summary - with use of google charts,
    * Details - showing more details,
        
The application was designed to be responsive.

### Tradeoffs

- Styling - not much focus was put on the styling and theming. Although the application was designed to be responsive and user friendly more styling adjustments could be made,
- CitySelector - the list of cities with available weather is currently retrieved from the json file, which is time and memory consuming (the file size is almost 30Mb). This should be managed in a different way, probably best to delegate debounced requests to the server and let the server do the filtering.
- Default city - for now it is (very ugly) hardcoded to Warsaw. It should be determined based on browser's navigator API (e.g. using vue-browser-geolocation module) or IP lookup.
- Metrics - The application supports only Celcius metric, while Kelvin, and Fahrenheit metrics are also supported by the OpenWeatherAPI,
- Usage of OpenWeatherMap default weather icons - A set of custom icons should be used.


### Possible Future Work
- Dealing with the tradeoffs,
- Optimize webpack chunk splitting configuration.
- Internationalization - for now support only of english language, though i18n support is configured so extension to more languages should be easy,
- Wind direction indicator - right now it is a string representation "N | NE | E | SE | S | WS | W | NW" a visual representation would be better.
- The Daily Summary forecast view with charts could be made more rich including more data (e.g rain, humidity) and more chart styling.
- The Details forecast views could also be improved showing more rich content.
